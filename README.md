# PdM_Predictor

# Three experiments for Journal Paper (2025)

# 1. Segmentaiton using multi-class ROIs
# 2. Segmentation using binary ROIs (only binary targets)

# 3. Segmentation using multi-class 1920x1080 images
# 4. Segmentation using binary 1920x1080 images (only binary targets)

# 5. Segmentation using multi-class square, resized images
# 6. Segmentation using binary square, resized images (only binary targets)

# Focus on 1, 2, 3, and 5





# Look into inference time correlation with network size

# Determine which models are best for uploading onto embedded systems.
# This can justify why we are using those specific models because it proves others have as well.
